# K-Means-Clustering
A quick weekend project to code K means clustering from scratch.

## What is K means clustering?
K means clustering, simply put, is a way of grouping data together.

Consider the following image of data:
# TODO EXPLAIN K MEANS CLUSLTERING HERE

The code takes an input of K's and an array (List in this case) of data. It will start on K=1 all the way up to K=(size of data)-1, and calcualte the variance of each K value.
After it will plot the variance in a graph for the user to determine the best K value with the "elbow technique"
